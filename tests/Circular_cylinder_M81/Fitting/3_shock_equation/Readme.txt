Shock Equation Computation and Point Distribution

1. The Hypersonic_Cylinder.py script requires the following input files: 
	SHOCK_DETECTED.xlsx – generated from UpdateNodeDetectShock.py
	Initial mesh files: na00.1.node and na00.1.poly
2. Upon execution, the script prompts the user to enter the desired number of shock points to be distributed along the detected shock curve.

3. It outputs shockpoints.xlsx, which is used to generate the shock data.

Important: Choose the number of shock points carefully to ensure that the overall shock shape and curvature are accurately preserved.
